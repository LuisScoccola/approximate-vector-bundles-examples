# Finite sample computation of characteristic classes

This repository contains the implementations and examples of the main algorithms in "Approximate and discrete Euclidean vector bundles", by L. Scoccola and J. Perea. Please see the notebooks for the examples and https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07563 for a description of the algorithms.

Required python packages: ripser, persim, matplotlib, python-flint (which requires FLINT: Fast Library for Number Theory), gmpy2, plotly, sklearn, numpy
